                        TANGY is a digital wellbeing coach for smartphones that actively reminds the user of their screen time. 
                        Visually, the application is represented by an avatar that floats above other applications on a user's smartphone. 
                        At its core, TANGY is a timer that keeps track of the time the user spends in respective applications. 
                        When the timer exceeds the set threshold for the specific app in use, it will actively give feedback about the usage to the user in the form of an animation and a pop-up notification. 
                        The goal of TANGY is to increase awareness of application time and alter habit through a sense of social control.

                            Visualization of algorithms and datastructures is a learning platform build for INF102 Algorithms, datastructures and programming, a course at the University of Bergen.
                            The platform offers six different algorithms with visualization for each of them. 
                            The visualizations is also interactive which allows you to carefully analyze each steps in the algorithm at your preferred speed. 
                            This project were build under the course INF219 Informatic project with a total of three students.
